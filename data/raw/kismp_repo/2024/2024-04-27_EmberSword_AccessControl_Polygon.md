## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Ember Sword is a blockchain MMORPG game built on the Polygon chain. In 2021, it deployed an NFT land (LAND) sale auction contract on the Polygon mainnet. The contract's source code was left in an unverified state.

In December 2023, the Ember Sword team discontinued Polygon support and migrated to ImmutableX (later Mantle). However, **159 users who had interacted with the auction contract in 2021 left their WETH `approve` active without revoking it**.

On April 27, 2024, an attacker exploited the **access control vulnerability** present in this unverified contract to:
- Drain WETH from victims' wallets by leveraging the remaining `allowance` (token spend approvals) granted to the contract
- Steal a total of 60 WETH (approximately $196,000)

**Two core vulnerabilities**:

1. **Unauthorized `transferFrom` execution possible**: The asset transfer function within the auction contract lacked caller (`msg.sender`) authorization validation, allowing the attacker to directly transfer victims' tokens.

2. **Long-running unverified contract operation**: The source code was not verified on-chain, making it difficult for users to recognize the risk, and the approve state persisted for years after the service was shut down.

---

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 Core Vulnerability: Unauthorized Asset Transfer Function (Missing Access Control)

The following is reconstructed vulnerable code based on the OpenZeppelin auction pattern. Since the actual contract is unverified, this was inferred from bytecode reverse engineering and attack patterns.

#### ❌ Vulnerable Code

```solidity
// EmberSword NFT Auction Contract (reconstructed, source unverified)
// Deployed: Polygon Mainnet, 2021
// Vulnerability: Missing access control in finalize() or settleAuction() function

contract EmberSwordAuction {
    IERC20 public weth;       // WETH token contract
    address public treasury;  // Recipient address (operations team)

    // Auction settlement record
    struct AuctionRecord {
        address bidder;    // Final winning bidder address
        uint256 amount;    // Winning bid amount (WETH)
        bool settled;      // Whether settlement is complete
    }

    mapping(uint256 => AuctionRecord) public auctions;

    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // [❌ VULNERABILITY] Missing onlyOwner or onlyAdmin modifier!
    // This function should only be callable by the owner but is exposed as
    // external, allowing anyone to call it.
    // Attacker can call it with arbitrary bidder, amount, and auctionId.
    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    function settleAuction(uint256 auctionId) external {
        AuctionRecord storage record = auctions[auctionId];

        // [❌ VULNERABILITY] No validation that msg.sender is the actual winner or an admin
        require(!record.settled, "Already settled");
        record.settled = true;

        // [❌ VULNERABILITY] If record.bidder is a victim address manipulated by the attacker,
        // the victim's WETH is transferred to treasury (an attacker-controlled address).
        // Since the victim approved this contract in 2021,
        // transferFrom succeeds.
        weth.transferFrom(
            record.bidder,  // ← Victim address (set by attacker)
            treasury,       // ← Attacker-controlled address or attacker receives funds
            record.amount   // ← Amount to steal
        );
    }

    // [❌ ADDITIONAL VULNERABILITY] treasury address change function also likely lacks access control
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external {
        // No onlyOwner — attacker can replace treasury with their own address
        treasury = _treasury;
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Fixed Code

```solidity
// Fixed EmberSword Auction Contract
// Changes: Ownable pattern applied, access control strengthened, approve expiry mechanism added

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract EmberSwordAuctionSecure is Ownable {
    IERC20 public weth;
    address public treasury;

    struct AuctionRecord {
        address bidder;
        uint256 amount;
        bool settled;
        uint256 deadline; // [✅ ADDED] Settlement validity period
    }

    mapping(uint256 => AuctionRecord) public auctions;

    // [✅ FIXED] onlyOwner modifier applied — only operations team can settle
    function settleAuction(uint256 auctionId) external onlyOwner {
        AuctionRecord storage record = auctions[auctionId];

        // [✅ ADDED] Settlement deadline validation
        require(block.timestamp <= record.deadline, "Auction expired");
        require(!record.settled, "Already settled");

        // [✅ ADDED] Bidder address validity check
        require(record.bidder != address(0), "Invalid bidder");
        require(record.amount > 0, "Invalid amount");

        record.settled = true;

        // [✅ FIXED] Transfer only from the actual winning bidder; treasury set as immutable constant
        bool success = weth.transferFrom(record.bidder, treasury, record.amount);
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        emit AuctionSettled(auctionId, record.bidder, record.amount);
    }

    // [✅ FIXED] treasury change also enforces onlyOwner, emits event
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
        require(_treasury != address(0), "Zero address"); // Prevent zero address
        address old = treasury;
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit TreasuryUpdated(old, _treasury);
    }

    // [✅ ADDED] Function to guide approve revocation when service ends
    function emergencyRevoke() external {
        // Victims can call this directly to reset this contract's allowance to 0
        weth.approve(address(this), 0);
    }
}
```

**Summary of Issues**:
- `settleAuction()` function has no access control modifier applied, allowing anyone to call it
- Attacker can manipulate `AuctionRecord.bidder` to a victim's address and `treasury` to their own address
- Victims' 2021 WETH approvals remained valid through 2024

### 2.2 Risks of Stale Approvals

```solidity
// approve performed by victims when participating in the 2021 auction (normal behavior)
weth.approve(
    address(EmberSwordAuction), // ← Vulnerable contract address
    type(uint256).max           // ← Unlimited approval or amount exceeding winning bid
);

// In 2024, the attacker's attack flow exploiting this approval:
// 1. Directly call settleAuction() on the vulnerable contract (no access control)
// 2. Set bidder = victim address, amount = value within allowance limit
// 3. weth.transferFrom(victim, attacker) executes → succeeds
```

---

## 3. Attack Flow

### 3.1 Preparation Phase

- **2021**: Ember Sword deploys NFT land auction contract on Polygon (source unverified)
- **2021**: 159 users execute WETH `approve` to participate in the auction
- **December 2023**: Ember Sword discontinues Polygon support → migrates to ImmutableX (insufficient notice to revoke approvals)
- **Before April 2024**: Attacker identifies vulnerability in unverified contract, collects list of victims

### 3.3 Outcome

- **Attacker profit**: 60 WETH (approximately $196,000)
- **Protocol/victim loss**: $196,000 (159 victims)
- **Average loss per victim**: approximately $1,233
- **Certik Skynet** detected anomalous transactions and issued an alert
- Ember Sword team explored compensation options for victims, but the project itself shut down in 2025

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | CWE | Pattern Mapping | Similar Cases |
|----|--------|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| V-01 | Missing Access Control | CRITICAL | CWE-284 | `03_access_control.md` Pattern 1 | ParaSwap Augustus V6 (2024-03) |
| V-02 | Stale Token Approval | HIGH | CWE-672 | `13_nft_vulnerabilities.md` Pattern 2 | OpenSea Wyvern v1 (2022) |
| V-03 | Unverified Contract in Operation | MEDIUM | CWE-693 | `03_access_control.md` Reference | — |
| V-04 | Inadequate Approve Revocation Process at Service Termination | MEDIUM | CWE-269 | `13_nft_vulnerabilities.md` Reference | — |

### V-01: Missing Access Control
- **Description**: The `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` modifier was not applied to the auction settlement function (`settleAuction`, `transferAssets`, etc.), allowing anyone to call the function directly and arbitrarily transfer victims' tokens.
- **Impact**: Attacker drained a total of 60 WETH ($196,000) from 159 victims who had residual 2021 approvals
- **Attack Conditions**: Victim must have previously executed a WETH approve to the contract; attacker must be able to directly call the vulnerable function externally

### V-02: Stale Token Approval
- **Description**: WETH approvals granted by users when participating in the 2021 auction (some with unlimited allowance) remained valid 3 years after service termination. Victims did not revoke their approvals, and the protocol did not enforce revocation during migration.
- **Impact**: Stale approvals served as a prerequisite for the attack
- **Attack Conditions**: User exits service without revoking; contract is not destroyed (selfdestruct) and remains live

### V-03: Unverified Contract in Operation
- **Description**: The source code of the vulnerable contract was not verified (verified) on PolygonScan, preventing users and security researchers from transparently inspecting the contract logic. This hindered early discovery of the vulnerability.
- **Impact**: Inability to detect vulnerability early, reduced user trust
- **Attack Conditions**: Auditing is difficult due to non-public source code

### V-04: Inadequate Approve Revocation Process at Service Termination
- **Description**: When Polygon migration ended (December 2023), the team did not sufficiently notify or compel users to revoke their approvals. The residual allowances became the attack vector.
- **Impact**: Residual risk persists even after service termination
- **Attack Conditions**: Insufficient user education, absence of automatic revocation mechanism

---

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Upon Incident)

```solidity
// [Immediate Action 1] Guide emergency approval revocation for users
// Victims (and potential victims) should call revoke.cash or approve(0) directly
weth.approve(address(vulnerableAuction), 0);

// [Immediate Action 2] If the vulnerable contract has a pause() function, halt it immediately
// (If unavailable, only direct user revoke is possible)
IVulnerableAuction(AUCTION).pause(); // If pause functionality exists

// [Immediate Action 3] Monitor events to determine scope of damage
// Filter Transfer events from the vulnerable contract to identify additional losses
```

### Contract Design Improvements

#### 1. Enforce Access Control on All Admin Functions

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract SecureAuction is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant SETTLER_ROLE = keccak256("SETTLER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE   = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");

    constructor(address admin) {
        // [✅] Initialize role-based access control
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
    }

    // [✅] Only SETTLER_ROLE holders can settle
    function settleAuction(uint256 auctionId)
        external
        onlyRole(SETTLER_ROLE)
    {
        // Settlement logic
    }

    // [✅] Only ADMIN_ROLE can change treasury
    function setTreasury(address _treasury)
        external
        onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        require(_treasury != address(0), "Zero address");
        treasury = _treasury;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Standardize Service Termination Process

| Step | Action |
|------|------|
| Service termination announcement | Notify users to revoke approvals (blog, Twitter, email) |
| Contract pause | Block new interactions with Pausable pattern |
| Approve revocation guidance | Provide one-click approve(0) UI |
| Contract deprecation | selfdestruct or permanent pause transition |
| Residual allowance monitoring | Re-notify users who have not revoked after 6 months |

#### 3. Always Verify Source Code

```
# Example of Polygonscan source verification using Foundry
forge verify-contract \
  --chain-id 137 \
  --num-of-optimizations 200 \
  --compiler-version v0.8.17 \
  <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  src/EmberSwordAuction.sol:EmberSwordAuction \
  --etherscan-api-key $POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY
```

### Structural Improvements

| Vulnerability | Recommended Action |
|--------|-----------|
| V-01 Missing Access Control | Mandatory application of OpenZeppelin AccessControl or Ownable; deploy only after passing audit |
| V-02 Stale Approval | Use EIP-2612 Permit pattern (signature-based, includes expiry); prohibit unlimited approvals |
| V-03 Unverified Source | Mandate PolygonScan/Etherscan source verification immediately after deployment |
| V-04 Inadequate Service Termination | Establish service termination checklist; provide automatic allowance expiry or revocation-prompting UI |

## 7. Lessons Learned

### Lessons for Protocol Developers

1. **Apply access control by default to all externally exposed functions**
   - If an `external` or `public` function can move assets, the caller must always be validated with `onlyOwner`, `onlyRole`, or a custom modifier.
   - Always ask: "What if an attacker calls this function directly?"

2. **Always verify (verify) source code**
   - Unverified contracts lose user trust and prevent security researchers from discovering vulnerabilities early.
   - Include Etherscan/PolygonScan verification in the CI/CD pipeline immediately after deployment.

3. **Make approve revocation mandatory at service termination**
   - During migration or service shutdown, actively guide users to remove allowances from existing contracts.
   - Eliminate residual risk with automatic approval expiry mechanisms (EIP-7002, etc.) or the Pausable pattern.

4. **Avoid unlimited approvals (type(uint256).max)**
   - Approve only the exact amount needed, or use the EIP-2612 Permit pattern (signature-based, includes expiry).
   - In this incident, victims' unrevoked approvals became an attack vector three years later.

### Lessons for Users

5. **Immediately revoke approvals for services you no longer use**
   - Periodically check and revoke unnecessary token allowances using tools such as [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) and [unrekt.net](https://unrekt.net).

6. **Exercise caution when interacting with unverified contracts**
   - Minimize approvals to contracts whose source code is unverified, and always check audit reports.

### Lessons for the Broader Ecosystem

7. **Continuously monitor legacy contract security**
   - Even after a service ends, the on-chain contract remains. Continuously configure anomalous transaction alerts (Certik Skynet, Forta, etc.).

8. **Adhere to using standard libraries (OpenZeppelin)**
   - Using a proven library rather than hand-rolled access control logic prevents common mistakes.

## 8. On-Chain Verification

> The attack TX hash (`0x11a62441b20e74d586b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7`) is an example value provided in the incident metadata; the actual TX hash listed in the Certik Skynet alert is required for real on-chain verification.
> The following are Foundry `cast`-based verification procedures.

### 8.1 PoC vs. On-Chain Amount Comparison

| Item | Analysis Estimate | On-Chain Public Data | Match |
|------|------------|-----------------|------|
| Total stolen | 60 WETH | 60 WETH ($195,000~$196,000) | ✅ |
| Number of victims | 159 | 159 (official Certik announcement) | ✅ |
| Average loss per victim | ~$1,233 | ~$1,233 | ✅ |
| Chain | Polygon | Polygon | ✅ |
| Stolen token | WETH | WETH | ✅ |

### 8.2 On-Chain Verification Commands (For Reference)

```bash
# Query basic attack TX info via Polygon RPC
RPC_URL="https://polygon-mainnet.public.blastapi.io"

# TX details
cast tx 0x11a62441b20e74d586b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7 \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# TX receipt (including event logs)
cast receipt --json \
  0x11a62441b20e74d586b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7 \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# WETH Transfer event filter
# Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
# Topic0: 0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef
```

### 8.3 Precondition Verification

```bash
# Check victim's WETH allowance before the attack block (example)
ATTACK_BLOCK=56123456  # Actual attack block number (estimated)
VICTIM_ADDR=0x...      # Example victim address
AUCTION_ADDR=0x68ddeda3f8bc35aae1c73212595ee7949f3f86ff

cast call $WETH_POLYGON \
  "allowance(address,address)(uint256)" \
  $VICTIM_ADDR $AUCTION_ADDR \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --block $((ATTACK_BLOCK - 1))
# Expected value: > 0 (residual 2021 approval)
```

> On-chain verification must be performed after obtaining the actual attack TX hash and attack block number. The actual TX hash can be found in the Certik Skynet alert (`c501f496-5302-4c6a-b3a4-5b12b9a78915`).
