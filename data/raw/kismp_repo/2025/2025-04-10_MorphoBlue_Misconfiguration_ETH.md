## 1. Vulnerability Overview

### Background: Morpho Blue and the Bundler Architecture

Morpho Blue is a permissionless lending protocol on Ethereum. Users interact through the Morpho App frontend to bundle complex DeFi operations — supply, withdraw, collateral management — into a single transaction. This functionality is handled by the **Bundler** contract.

- **Bundler2 (legacy)**: Users approve ERC-20 tokens directly to the Bundler → Bundler executes operations via adapters
- **Bundler3 (new)**: Token approvals must be granted only to the **Adapter contract**, not to the Bundler3 contract itself

The core security assumption of the Bundler3 architecture is:
> _Users must not grant token approvals directly to the Bundler3 contract. Approvals must always be granted to adapters, which prevent unauthorized transfers via initiator-based access control._

### Incident Trigger

On April 10, 2025, the Morpho development team updated the Morpho App SDK from Bundler2 to a **Bundler3-integrated version**. However, the updated SDK contained a misconfiguration:

- **Error**: When the SDK (e.g., `@morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem`) constructed user transaction bundles, it directed token approvals to the **Bundler3 contract address** directly, rather than to an **adapter address** such as Ethereum General Adapter1.
- **Consequence**: Unlike adapters, Bundler3 has no initiator-based access control, meaning anyone who detected such an approval in the mempool could exploit it to drain the approved tokens.

### Whitehat Intervention and Resolution

Known whitehat MEV operator **c0ffeebabe.eth** detected the vulnerable transactions in the mempool and front-ran malicious actors to intercept approximately **1,708.64 ETH ($2,601,443)**. The funds were subsequently returned in full to the affected users, and c0ffeebabe.eth received a bug bounty reward through Immunefi.

The Morpho team rolled back the frontend update **within 4 minutes** of receiving the security alert.

> **Key Point**: This incident was caused by an **off-chain SDK misconfiguration**, not a flaw in the on-chain smart contracts themselves. The Morpho Blue protocol contracts functioned correctly.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 SDK Approval Target Misconfiguration (Core Vulnerability)

**Vulnerable SDK Behavior (pseudocode)**:

```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable: approval target is Bundler3 contract itself, not the adapter
// Misconfiguration in @morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem

// Approval generated when constructing user transaction bundle
IERC20(token).approve(
    address(bundler3),        // ❌ Bundler3 contract — no access control!
    amountNeededForTx         // Approves exact amount (no excess)
);
```

**Correct Behavior (after patch)**:

```solidity
// ✅ Fixed: approval target set to the adapter contract
// @morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem@3.0.0-next.14 and later

// Approval generated when constructing user transaction bundle
IERC20(token).approve(
    address(generalAdapter1), // ✅ Ethereum General Adapter1 — has initiator access control
    amountNeededForTx
);
```

**Problem**: Unlike adapters, the Bundler3 contract has no access control logic to validate the transaction initiator. Therefore, any external actor can exploit an approval granted to Bundler3 to transfer a user's tokens.

### 2.2 Bundler3 vs. Adapter Access Control Comparison

**Bundler3 Contract (vulnerable)**:

```solidity
// ❌ Bundler3: no initiator validation
// Address: 0x6566194141eefa99af43bb5aa71460ca2dc90245
contract Bundler3 {
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable {
        // Executes without checking initiator
        // Anyone can exploit this if approval is granted to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; ++i) {
            (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);
            require(success);
        }
    }
}
```

**GeneralAdapter1 Contract (safe)**:

```solidity
// ✅ GeneralAdapter1: initiator-based access control
// Address: 0x4a6c312ec70e8747a587ee860a0353cd42be0ae0
contract GeneralAdapter1 {
    address public immutable BUNDLER3;

    modifier onlyBundler3() {
        require(msg.sender == BUNDLER3, "not bundler");
        _;
    }

    // Validates initiator to ensure only the transaction originator benefits
    function transferFrom(address token, address from, uint256 amount)
        external onlyBundler3
    {
        // ✅ Only allows calls via Bundler3 → only the original transaction initiator benefits
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
    }
}
```

## 3. Attack Flow

### 3.1 Setup Phase

- Attack prerequisite: When a Morpho App user attempts any supply/withdraw operation after the Bundler3 update, the misconfigured SDK automatically generates a transaction that grants a token approval to the Bundler3 contract.
- The attacker requires no special preparation — only monitoring the Ethereum mempool.

### 3.2 Execution Phase

```
Step 1: Propagation of SDK-misconfigured transaction
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Victim (EOA)
      │
      │  approve(Bundler3, amount)   ← ❌ Approval to Bundler3, not the adapter
      ▼
  Ethereum Mempool (publicly pending)
      │
      ├──▶ Scheduled for normal mining (victim's intent)
      │
      └──▶ Detected by attacker/MEV bot monitoring the mempool
```

```
Step 2: Front-run execution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Mempool monitor (attacker or whitehat c0ffeebabe.eth)
      │
      │  Submits transaction ahead with higher gas
      ▼
  Ethereum miner/validator
      │
      │  Processes attacker's transaction first
      ▼
  Bundler3.multicall([
      transferFrom(token, victim, amount)  ← Exploits approval granted to Bundler3
  ])
      │
      │  transferFrom succeeds (approval exists)
      ▼
  ~1,708.64 ETH worth of funds moved to attacker/whitehat address
```

```
Step 3: Whitehat response and resolution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  c0ffeebabe.eth
      │
      ├── Intercepts funds ($2,601,443 worth)
      │
      ├── Reports vulnerability to Morpho team and Immunefi
      │
      └── Returns full amount to victims + receives bug bounty
          │
  Morpho team
      │
      ├── Rolls back frontend within 4 minutes of receiving alert
      │
      └── Deploys patched SDK versions
          - @morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem@3.0.0-next.14
          - @morpho-org/blue-sdk-viem@3.0.0-next.6

}

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

contract ConceptualExploitDemo {
    IBundler3 constant bundler3 = IBundler3(0x6566194141eefa99Af43Bb5Aa71460Ca2Dc90245);

    function exploit(
        address victim,      // Victim who sent a misconfigured approve
        address token,       // Token the victim approved
        uint256 amount       // Amount the victim approved

        require(allowance >= amount, "no approval");

        // Step 2: Transfer victim's tokens via Bundler3.multicall

        );

        // ❌ Bundler3 does not block this call (no access control)
        bundler3.multicall(calls);

        // Step 3: Funds moved to attacker's wallet
        // In practice, c0ffeebabe.eth (whitehat) executed this first and returned the funds

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | CWE |
|----|--------|--------|-----|
| V-01 | SDK off-chain misconfiguration — incorrect approval target | CRITICAL | CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment) |
| V-02 | Bundler3 missing access control — no initiator validation | HIGH | CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) |
| V-03 | Mempool public exposure — sensitive transactions susceptible to front-running | MEDIUM | CWE-362 (Race Condition) |

### V-01: SDK Off-Chain Misconfiguration

- **Description**: The frontend SDK (`@morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem`) incorrectly set the token approval target to the Bundler3 contract itself instead of an adapter contract during the Bundler3 integration update.
- **Impact**: When users execute transactions through the Morpho App, token access rights are unintentionally granted to the Bundler3 contract rather than the intended adapter.
- **Attack Condition**: User performs an operation on the Morpho App while the misconfigured SDK version is deployed.

### V-02: Bundler3 Missing Access Control

- **Description**: Unlike adapters, the Bundler3 contract has no logic to validate the original user (initiator) who initiated the transaction. Therefore, if an approval is granted to Bundler3, external attackers can also exploit that approval.
- **Impact**: Token approvals granted to Bundler3 can be diverted for purposes other than their original intent.
- **Attack Condition**: User sends or exposes to the mempool a transaction that approves tokens to Bundler3 (chained with V-01).

### V-03: Mempool Public Exposure

- **Description**: User transaction data is exposed in Ethereum's public mempool before mining. When a vulnerable approval is exposed in the mempool due to V-01, anyone can detect and front-run it.
- **Impact**: Had a malicious actor front-run instead of the whitehat, the funds would have been genuinely stolen.
- **Attack Condition**: Operating a mempool monitoring bot on the public Ethereum mempool.

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

```typescript
// ✅ Fix: always direct approvals to the adapter
// Applied in @morpho-org/bundler-sdk-viem@3.0.0-next.14 and later

// Misconfigured (vulnerable)
const approvalTarget = bundler3Address; // ❌

// Correct configuration (after fix)
const approvalTarget = generalAdapter1Address; // ✅
// Or dynamically query the adapter address by chain
const approvalTarget = await bundler3.getAdapter(chainId);
```

```solidity
// ✅ Add defensive logic to Bundler3 to block direct approvals (defensive design)
contract Bundler3 {
    // Explicitly prevent this contract from being used as an approval target
    function _checkNotDirectApprovalTarget() internal view {
        // Prevent direct-approval pattern at SDK level
        // At contract level, add initiator validation on transferFrom calls
        require(
            initiator != address(0) && initiator == _getOriginalCaller(),
            "Bundler3: direct approval forbidden"
        );
    }
}
```

### Structural Improvements

| Vulnerability | Recommended Action |
|--------|-----------|
| V-01: SDK misconfiguration | Add automated tests to verify approval target addresses before SDK deployment; hardcode adapter addresses as constants and strengthen code review |
| V-02: Missing access control | Add initiator tracking and validation logic to Bundler3; enforce adapter pattern as the mandatory routing path |
| V-03: Mempool exposure | Use private mempools (Flashbots MEV-Protect, etc.) for sensitive approval transactions; replace direct approvals with EIP-2612 permit pattern |
| Overall | Conduct periodic external security audits of off-chain SDK/frontend code; extend smart contract audit scope to include SDKs and integration layers |

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Off-chain code must be audited too**: This incident was caused not by a bug in on-chain smart contracts, but by a misconfiguration in the SDK and frontend. Security audits for DeFi protocols must encompass off-chain code (SDKs, APIs, frontends) as well.

2. **Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege**: In smart contract systems, token approvals (approvals) should be granted to the narrowest possible set of contracts. Never grant direct approvals to contracts that lack access control.

3. **Security validation is critical during architecture transitions**: Changes to core architecture — such as the migration from Bundler2 to Bundler3 — require a dedicated process to verify the security impact of changes to approval flows.

4. **Use the permit pattern to minimize approval exposure**: Using the EIP-2612 `permit` function allows the approval to be processed together with the main transaction rather than being independently exposed in the mempool, reducing front-running risk.

5. **Collaboration with the whitehat ecosystem**: It was fortunate that c0ffeebabe.eth discovered and exploited the vulnerability before a malicious actor did. Active bug bounty programs (such as Immunefi) and the whitehat ecosystem serve as a practical line of defense for DeFi security.

6. **Rapid incident response**: The Morpho team's ability to roll back the frontend within 4 minutes of receiving the alert was critical to minimizing damage. Real-time monitoring and an immediate response framework are essential in DeFi security.
