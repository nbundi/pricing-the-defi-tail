## 1. Vulnerability Overview

The SafeMoon protocol suffered approximately $8,900,000 in losses on March 28, 2023, due to a **missing access control** on the `burn()` function.

SafeMoon's `burn(address from, uint256 amount)` function was **callable by anyone** without an `onlyOwner` or equivalent access control modifier. The attacker exploited this to directly burn SafeMoon tokens held by the PancakeSwap LP pool address (= `uniswapV2Pair`), artificially collapsing the token ratio within the pool.

**Core Attack Mechanism:**
1. Flash loan 1,000 WBNB
2. Swap WBNB → SFM (purchase SFM from the LP pool)
3. Call `burn(LP address, LP balance - 1_000_000_000)` → force-burn the LP pool's SFM supply
4. Call `burn(SFM contract, SFM balance)` → burn the entire SFM balance held by the contract
5. Call `sync()` → update the LP pool's internal reserve values (reflecting the burn)
6. Swap held SFM back to WBNB → drain most of the WBNB remaining in the pool
7. Repay flash loan (including 0.3% fee) and realize profit

This attack combines an **Access Control vulnerability** with **LP price manipulation**, caused by a single missing modifier with no complex mathematical manipulation required.

---

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 Public burn() Function — Missing Access Control (Core Vulnerability)

**Vulnerable Code (reconstructed)**:
```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable: anyone can burn tokens from any address
// No access control modifier such as onlyOwner or onlyBridge
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external {
    // Burns balance of arbitrary address without caller validation
    _burn(from, amount);
}

function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");
    _balances[account] -= amount;  // ❌ Balance decremented
    _totalSupply -= amount;         // ❌ Total supply decremented
    emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
}
```

**Fixed Code (post-patch)**:
```solidity
// ✅ Fixed: only authorized parties can call burn()
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(
        msg.sender == owner() ||
        msg.sender == bridgeContract ||
        msg.sender == burnManager,
        "SafeMoon: caller is not authorized"
    );
    _;
}

// ✅ Safe burn function with access control applied
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
    _burn(from, amount);
}
```

**Issue**: The `burn()` function has `external` visibility but performs no authorization check, allowing an attacker to pass the LP pool address (`uniswapV2Pair`) as the `from` argument and burn the entire SFM balance held in the LP pool.

---

### 2.2 LP Pool Price Update Mechanism — sync() Abuse

**Vulnerable flow**:
```solidity
// The LP pool's internal reserve does not immediately reflect actual balance changes
// After burn(), the actual balanceOf(pair) is reduced,
// but pair's internal reserve0/reserve1 still holds the previous values

// ❌ Attacker directly calls sync() to force reserve update
interface IUniswapV2Pair {
    function sync() external; // ← publicly callable by anyone
}

// sync() internals (UniswapV2 standard)
function sync() external lock {
    _update(
        IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)), // reduced value after burn
        IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)),
        reserve0,
        reserve1
    );
}
```

**Issue**: `sync()` is a standard UniswapV2 function callable by anyone. After burning the LP pool's SFM via `burn()`, the attacker called `sync()` to force an update of the reserve values used for price calculation within the LP. This caused the WBNB/SFM exchange rate to become extremely favorable to the attacker.

---

### 2.3 Public mint() Function — Missing Access Control (Secondary Vulnerability)

The `testMint()` test in the PoC demonstrates that, at the block just before the attack (26,854,757), the `mint()` function was also callable without access control.

```solidity
// ❌ Anyone can mint to an arbitrary address up to bridgeBurnAddress's balance
function mint(address user, uint256 amount) external {
    // No authorization check — callable by anyone
    _mint(user, amount);
}
```

The actual attack (block 26,864,890) primarily exploited `burn()`, but `mint()` carries the same vulnerability.

---

## 3. Attack Flow

### 3.1 Preparation Phase

- Deploy attacker contract (implementing PancakeSwap flash loan callback `pancakeCall`)
- No special pre-approvals or token accumulation required

### 3.2 Execution Phase

```
Step 1: Request PancakeSwap flash loan
Step 2: Receive pancakeCall callback → execute doBurnHack
  2-1: Swap WBNB → SFM (input 1,000 WBNB)
  2-2: Call burn(LP address, LP balance - 1 billion) → mass-burn SFM in LP
  2-3: Call burn(SFM contract, SFM balance) → burn contract balance
  2-4: Call sync() → update LP reserves
  2-5: Reverse swap SFM → WBNB (at extremely favorable rate)
Step 3: Repay flash loan (1,000 WBNB + 0.3% fee)
Step 4: Realize profit (~27,463 WBNB received)
```

---

### V-01: Public burn() Function — Missing Access Control

- **Description**: The `SafeMoon.burn(address from, uint256 amount)` function has `external` visibility but contains no authorization check (modifier or require). This allows any external caller to freely burn SFM tokens from **any address, including LP pools**.
- **Impact**: Full burn of LP pool's SFM balance → collapse of AMM price formula (x\*y=k) → extremely favorable exchange rate for attacker → large-scale fund drainage
- **Attack Conditions**: Achievable via simple external call. No admin privileges, special approvals, or prior token holdings required.

---

### V-02: AMM Price Manipulation via Direct LP Pool Burn

- **Description**: UniswapV2-based AMMs determine prices using the `reserve0 * reserve1 = k` invariant. When `burn()` drives the LP's SFM `reserve0` close to zero, `k` collapses, and a subsequent `sync()` call finalizes this state. Any swap thereafter allows the attacker to withdraw a large amount of WBNB with a minimal amount of SFM, per the `k` invariant formula.
- **Impact**: Total drainage of WBNB liquidity from the SafeMoon LP pool
- **Attack Conditions**: Requires V-01 vulnerability as a prerequisite. LP pool must have existing liquidity.

---

### V-03: Public mint() Function — Missing Access Control

- **Description**: Identical to `burn()`, the `mint(address user, uint256 amount)` function also lacks access control. As confirmed by the `testMint()` test in the PoC, an attacker can mint SFM tokens up to the `bridgeBurnAddress`'s balance to any arbitrary address.
- **Impact**: Unlimited token minting causing inflation and further price manipulation
- **Attack Conditions**: Achievable via simple external call.

---

### V-04: Atomic Attack via Flash Loan

- **Description**: The attacker used a PancakeSwap flash loan to source 1,000 WBNB with no capital of their own. This reduces the attack cost to near zero (only ~3 WBNB in fees required) and provides an automatic rollback safety net in the event of transaction failure.
- **Impact**: Minimal barrier to attack entry, risk-free profit realization
- **Attack Conditions**: Combinable whenever V-01 vulnerability is present.

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Code Level)

```solidity
// ✅ Fix 1: Add authorization check to burn() function
// Role-based access control recommended (OpenZeppelin AccessControl)

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract SafeMoon is ERC20, AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant BURNER_ROLE = keccak256("BURNER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    // ✅ Only BURNER_ROLE holders can burn
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }

    // ✅ Only MINTER_ROLE holders can mint
    function mint(address user, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
}
```

```solidity
// ✅ Fix 2: Add protective logic to exclude LP pool address from burn targets
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
    // LP pool cannot be specified as burn target
    require(from != uniswapV2Pair, "SafeMoon: cannot burn LP tokens");
    require(from != address(this), "SafeMoon: cannot burn contract balance");
    _burn(from, amount);
}
```

### Structural Improvements

| Vulnerability | Recommended Action |
|--------|-----------|
| Public burn/mint | Introduce OpenZeppelin AccessControl with role-based permission separation |
| LP price manipulation | Use TWAP oracle (avoid reliance on simple spot price) |
| Single-function vulnerability | During audits, mandatory review of access control on all `external/public` functions |
| Flash loan combination | Add `nonReentrant` modifier and flash loan defense logic to sensitive functions |
| Upgrade safety | Establish verification procedures to ensure access control settings are not reset during upgrades |

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Default all external functions to `restricted` access**: Functions that modify token supply — such as `burn()` and `mint()` — must always have a modifier like `onlyOwner` or `onlyRole`. A single missing modifier can threaten an entire protocol.

2. **Treat LP pool addresses as a special trust boundary**: AMM LP pools are the core of a protocol's liquidity. Functions that modify token balances related to LP (burns, transfers, etc.) must explicitly protect LP addresses.

3. **`sync()` is publicly callable**: UniswapV2's `sync()` is a standard interface callable by anyone. Protocol design must assume that external LP reserves can be updated at any time by any party.

4. **Flash loans are a leverage tool for access control vulnerabilities**: A flash loan alone is not dangerous, but combined with an access control vulnerability, it enables large-scale attacks with zero capital. A single vulnerable function can put all protocol liquidity at risk.

5. **Independent smart contract audits are mandatory**: The `burn()`/`mint()` vulnerability in SafeMoon would have been discoverable in even a basic audit. Review by multiple independent auditing firms before deployment is essential.

6. **Never assume "functions behave as if they were private"**: Some developers assume that certain functions are used in a limited way based on internal documentation or convention. On the blockchain, however, constraints not explicitly stated in code do not exist.

3. `SafeMoon.burn(uniswapV2Pair, ...)` — LP pool SFM burned ❌
4. `SafeMoon.burn(address(sfmoon), ...)` — contract SFM burned ❌
5. `IUniswapV2Pair.sync()` — LP reserves force-updated
6. `SafeSwapTradeRouter.swapExactTokensForTokensWithFeeAmount()` — SFM → WBNB
7. `WETH.transfer(pancakePair, ...)` — flash loan repaid
