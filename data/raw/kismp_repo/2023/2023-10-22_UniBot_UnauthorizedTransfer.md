## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

`UniBotRouter` is the router for the UniBot trading bot. Victims had previously called `approve()` on this router to authorize token trading. The vulnerable function corresponding to selector `0xb2bd16ab` was able to `transferFrom()` victims' tokens to an arbitrary address. This attack followed the same pattern as the MaestroRouter2 exploit.

```solidity
// Vulnerable pattern: Router transferring victim tokens to arbitrary address
contract UniBotRouter {
    // Vulnerable: accepts victim address and recipient as parameters, then executes transferFrom
    // Function selector: 0xb2bd16ab
    function executeTransfer(
        address token,
        address from,    // victim
        address to,      // attacker
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        // No caller validation
        // Any amount within what `from` approved to the Router can be transferred arbitrarily
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(from, to, amount);
    }
}
```

**Vulnerability**: The `0xb2bd16ab` function in UniBotRouter accepted parameters in the form `(address from, address to, address token, uint256 amount)` and could directly transfer victims' tokens to the attacker. All users who had approved tokens to the Router in order to use UniBot were affected.

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| Field | Details |
|------|------|
| CWE | CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) |
| Vulnerability Type | Unauthorized transferFrom via Router vulnerable function |
| Impact Scope | All users who approved tokens to UniBotRouter |
| Explorer | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x126c9FbaB3A2FCA24eDfd17322E71a5e36E91865) |

## 6. Security Recommendations

```solidity
// Fix 1: Only allow transferFrom on msg.sender's tokens
contract UniBotRouter {
    function executeSwap(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address recipient
    ) external {
        // Only msg.sender's tokens can be moved
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }

    // Remove entirely any function that accepts a `from` parameter
}

// Fix 2: Only allow approved delegates to perform transfers on behalf
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public approvedDelegates;

function transferOnBehalf(
    address token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) external {
    require(approvedDelegates[from][msg.sender], "Not approved delegate");
    IERC20(token).transferFrom(from, to, amount);
}

// Fix 3: Periodic approval invalidation mechanism
// Invalidate existing approvals when the Router contract is upgraded
uint256 public approvalEpoch;

function invalidateApprovals() external onlyOwner {
    approvalEpoch++;
    // Invalidates all approvals from the previous epoch
}
```

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Shared vulnerability pattern in trading bot Routers**: Both MaestroRouter2 and UniBotRouter were exploited on the same dates (2023-10-03 / 2023-10-22) via nearly identical vulnerabilities. Trading bot Routers share the same vulnerable patterns and are therefore compromised simultaneously.
2. **Persistent risk of unlimited approvals**: Unlimited approvals that users grant to trading bots expose all approved tokens whenever the Router is compromised or found to be vulnerable. Approvals should be revoked immediately after use.
3. **Critical importance of Router audits**: Trading bot Routers concentrate approvals from many users, meaning a single vulnerability can harm all users at once. Thorough security audits before deployment are mandatory.
4. **Risk proportional to popularity**: Routers for widely used trading bots (MaestroBot, UniBot) represent a larger pool of victims for attackers. The more popular a Router is, the higher its security bar must be.
