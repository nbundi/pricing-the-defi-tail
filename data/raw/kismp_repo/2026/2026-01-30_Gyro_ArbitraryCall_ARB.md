## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Gyro.finance is a liquidity management and automatic rebalancing protocol operating on the Arbitrum network. Users grant ERC-20 `approve` allowances to Gyro's router or vault contracts in order to enter positions and provide liquidity.

On January 30, 2026, an attacker exploited an **Arbitrary External Call vulnerability** present in Gyro.finance contracts to directly steal tokens from users who had previously granted approvals to the protocol. Total losses amounted to approximately $700,000.

The core pattern of the arbitrary external call vulnerability is as follows:

- **No validation of call target address**: When a router function determines the external call target address (`target`) from user-supplied parameters, it does not verify whether that address is an approved DEX or protocol contract.
- **No calldata validation**: The function does not block dangerous function selectors such as `transferFrom` or `approve` from the calldata, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary ERC-20 operations.
- **Abuse of context privileges**: Since the router contract executes external calls as `msg.sender`, the `allowance` that users have granted to that router is turned into an attack vector.

This pattern is a representative DeFi vulnerability type that has been repeatedly exploited — including SushiSwap RouteProcessor in 2023 ($3.3M), Seneca Protocol in 2024 ($6M), and SwapNet ($13.4M) and Aperture Finance ($3.67M) in January 2026.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 No Validation of Arbitrary Call Target (Core Vulnerability)

The Gyro.finance router (or vault) contract has functionality to call external DEXs or protocols for batch execution of swaps and position entries. In this process, the user-supplied `target` address and `calldata` are executed without validation.

```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable code (pattern estimated — Arbitrary Call vulnerability)
// Function name: execute(), swap(), performCall() or similar

function execute(
    address target,       // ❌ Call target address — user-controlled, no validation
    bytes calldata data   // ❌ Calldata — user-controlled, no validation
) external payable {
    // ❌ Does not verify whether target is on an approved DEX/protocol list
    // ❌ Does not check data for dangerous selectors like transferFrom
    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, "Execute failed");
}
```

```solidity
// ✅ Fixed code — whitelist-based target validation + dangerous selector blocking

// List of approved call target addresses (updatable by admin only)
mapping(address => bool) public approvedTargets;

// List of prohibited function selectors
bytes4 constant TRANSFER_FROM  = bytes4(keccak256("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"));
bytes4 constant APPROVE        = bytes4(keccak256("approve(address,uint256)"));
bytes4 constant TRANSFER       = bytes4(keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)"));

function execute(
    address target,
    bytes calldata data
) external payable {
    // ✅ (1) Only allow calls to whitelisted contracts
    require(approvedTargets[target], "Gyro: unapproved call target");

    // ✅ (2) Explicitly block dangerous function selectors
    if (data.length >= 4) {
        bytes4 sel = bytes4(data[:4]);
        require(
            sel != TRANSFER_FROM &&
            sel != APPROVE &&
            sel != TRANSFER,
            "Gyro: forbidden selector"
        );
    }

    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, "Execute failed");
}
```

**Issue**: The router contract uses a user-supplied address (`target`) as the external call destination without validation. An attacker can replace `target` with an ERC-20 token contract and manipulate `data` to encode `transferFrom(victim, attacker, total_approved_balance)`. Since the router holds the victim's token `allowance`, this `transferFrom` call succeeds.

---

### 2.2 Limitations of Blacklist-Based Defense (Secondary Vulnerability)

Some protocols apply a blacklist as a defense against arbitrary calls, but this approach is fundamentally incomplete.

```solidity
// ❌ Incomplete defense — blacklist only blocks known addresses

mapping(address => bool) public blacklisted;

function execute(address target, bytes calldata data) external payable {
    // ❌ Any ERC-20 token address not on the blacklist can be called
    require(!blacklisted[target], "Gyro: blocked address");

    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, "Execute failed");
}
```

```solidity
// ✅ Fixed code — switch to allowlist approach (deny-by-default principle)

mapping(address => bool) public allowlisted;

function execute(address target, bytes calldata data) external payable {
    // ✅ Only addresses explicitly registered on the allowlist can be called (deny by default)
    require(allowlisted[target], "Gyro: unregistered call target — check allowlist");

    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, "Execute failed");
}
```

**Issue**: A blacklist is a reactive defense that only blocks known malicious addresses. An attacker can immediately bypass it by using any ERC-20 token address not on the blacklist as `target`. Only a proactive allowlist-based defense effectively stops this vulnerability.

---

## 3. Attack Flow

### 3.1 Preparation Phase

- Victims had previously granted ERC-20 token approvals (`approve`) to the Gyro.finance router/vault contract during normal transactions
- Attacker analyzed Arbitrum on-chain event logs to collect a list of victim addresses holding valid `allowance` for that contract
- Attacker constructed malicious parameters via an attack contract or EOA

### 3.2 Execution Phase

1. **Target selection**: Attacker identified addresses with sufficient token approvals to the Gyro router via `Approval` event logs
2. **Malicious parameter construction**: Prepared manipulated parameters with `target = ERC-20_token_contract_address` and `data = transferFrom(victim, attacker, balance)`
3. **Vulnerable function call**: Attacker called the execution function on the Gyro.finance router
4. **Router executes call to token**: Router executes `transferFrom` against the ERC-20 token contract without validation
5. **Token transfer succeeds**: ERC-20 contract verifies `allowance[victim][router] >= amount` and transfers tokens
6. **Repeat**: Attacker repeats the same process for multiple victims
7. **Fund movement**: Stolen tokens are swapped or moved to a mixer

### 3.4 Outcome

- **Attacker profit**: Approximately $700,000 worth of tokens
- **Protocol direct TVL loss**: None (damage occurred from user wallets that had granted approvals to the router)
- **Affected scope**: All users who had granted `approve` to the Gyro.finance router/vault are at potential risk

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | CWE | Matching Pattern | Similar Incidents |
|----|--------|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| V-01 | Unvalidated call target address (arbitrary external call) | CRITICAL | CWE-20 | `patterns/03_access_control.md` | SwapNet 2026-01, Seneca 2024-02, SushiSwap 2023-04 |
| V-02 | No blocking of dangerous function selectors | CRITICAL | CWE-285 | `patterns/07_token_integration.md` | Aperture Finance 2026-01, Dexible 2023-02 |
| V-03 | Architecture dependent on unlimited/large token approvals | HIGH | CWE-284 | `patterns/07_token_integration.md` | SocketGateway 2024-01, HedgeyFinance 2024-04 |
| V-04 | Improper access control (blacklist defense) | HIGH | CWE-284 | `patterns/03_access_control.md` | Seneca 2024-02 |

### V-01: Unvalidated Call Target Address (Arbitrary External Call)

- **Description**: The router contract's execution function uses a user-supplied `target` address as the external call destination without validation. An attacker can replace `target` with an ERC-20 token contract and inject a `transferFrom` call leveraging the `allowance` the router holds on behalf of users.
- **Impact**: Tokens from all users who have granted approvals to the router can be stolen in a single transaction. Users who granted unlimited approvals are immediately exposed to total balance loss.
- **Attack conditions**: (1) Victim holds an ERC-20 `approve` on the vulnerable contract, (2) attacker can call the execution function with arbitrary parameters

### V-02: No Blocking of Dangerous Function Selectors

- **Description**: There is no logic to parse the function selector (`bytes4`) from user-supplied `data` and block token transfer-related function calls such as `transferFrom (0x23b872dd)`, `approve (0x095ea7b3)`, and `transfer (0xa9059cbb)`.
- **Impact**: Combined with V-01, this completes the token theft vector. Adding selector blocking alone would have prevented the direct damage from this attack.
- **Attack conditions**: Same as V-01. Selector filtering is a complementary defense layer alongside whitelisting.

### V-03: Architecture Dependent on Unlimited/Large Token Approvals

- **Description**: Gyro.finance's UX design encourages users to grant large or unlimited `approve` to the router in order to use the protocol. This maximizes damage when a router vulnerability occurs.
- **Impact**: Structural risk enabling hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses from a single vulnerability. If approvals were limited to the swap amount, damage would have been capped at that transaction amount.
- **Attack conditions**: User has already granted sufficient `approve`

### V-04: Improper Access Control (Blacklist Defense)

- **Description**: If a blacklist-based defense exists, it is a reactive defense that only blocks known addresses and is fundamentally incomplete. An attacker can immediately bypass it by using any ERC-20 token address not on the blacklist.
- **Impact**: Provides a false sense of security — appearing to have security controls while being effectively neutralized.
- **Attack conditions**: Immediately exploitable by specifying any contract address not on the blacklist as `target`

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

```solidity
// ✅ Fix 1: Enforce call target whitelist (switch from blacklist to allowlist)
mapping(address => bool) public approvedTargets;

// Admin registers only approved DEXs/protocols (deny-by-default principle)
function setApprovedTarget(address target, bool approved) external onlyOwner {
    approvedTargets[target] = approved;
    emit TargetApprovalUpdated(target, approved);
}

// ✅ Fix 2: Dangerous selector block list
bytes4 constant TRANSFER_FROM_SEL = bytes4(keccak256("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"));
bytes4 constant APPROVE_SEL       = bytes4(keccak256("approve(address,uint256)"));
bytes4 constant TRANSFER_SEL      = bytes4(keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)"));

// ✅ Fix 3: Apply multi-layer validation to execute() function
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes calldata data
) external payable nonReentrant {
    // Validation 1: Whitelist check (deny-by-default principle)
    require(approvedTargets[target], "Gyro: unapproved call target — whitelist registration required");

    // Validation 2: Block dangerous selectors
    if (data.length >= 4) {
        bytes4 sel = bytes4(data[:4]);
        require(
            sel != TRANSFER_FROM_SEL &&
            sel != APPROVE_SEL &&
            sel != TRANSFER_SEL,
            "Gyro: forbidden function selector (transferFrom/approve/transfer)"
        );
    }

    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, "Gyro: external call failed");
}
```

### Structural Improvements

| Vulnerability | Recommended Action |
|--------|-----------|
| V-01 Unvalidated call target | Introduce DEX/protocol address whitelist. Governance-based list management. Apply deny-by-default principle |
| V-02 No dangerous selector blocking | Explicitly block `transferFrom`, `approve`, `transfer` selectors. Consider allowlist approach for permitted selectors |
| V-03 Unlimited approval architecture | Introduce Permit2 (EIP-2612) single-use authorization. Encourage minimum approvals based on swap amount. Remove unlimited approval as default in frontend |
| V-04 Blacklist defense | Switch from deny-list (blacklist) → allow-list (allowlist) approach. Mandate security review process when adding new addresses |

**Additional Recommendations**:
- **Circuit Breaker**: Build automated pause or immediate manual response mechanism triggered by anomalous transactions (large `allowance` usage in a short period)
- **Rate Limiting**: Set maximum withdrawal amount per address per unit time
- **On-chain Monitoring System**: Real-time alert system for detecting abnormal `allowance` usage patterns (Forta, Tenderly, etc.)
- **Mandatory Source Code Verification**: Register and verify all contract source code on Arbiscan. Ensure community auditability

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Arbitrary external calls are the most dangerous pattern in DeFi routers/aggregators**: Contracts that execute user-supplied addresses and calldata without validation turn every `allowance` granted to that contract into an attack vector. Call targets must be strictly limited by whitelist, and a deny-by-default principle must be applied.

2. **Blacklists are reactive defenses and cannot replace whitelists**: Blacklists only block known threats. Attackers can always find new paths not on the blacklist. Only proactive allowlist-based defense fundamentally blocks this pattern.

3. **Token selector blocking is an essential layer of defense-in-depth**: Explicitly blocking `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `transfer` selectors from external call calldata is an independent defense layer from whitelisting. Both must be applied.

4. **Infinite Approvals amplify protocol risk**: When users grant infinite approvals, a single router vulnerability leads to total balance loss for those users. Protocols should encourage minimum necessary approval amounts and adopt single-use authorization mechanisms such as Permit2/EIP-2612.

5. **The same vulnerability pattern is repeatedly exploited**: The Arbitrary Call vulnerability has been repeatedly exploited from 2023 through 2026 across SushiSwap, Dexible, Seneca, Socket, HedgeyFinance, Unizen, SwapNet, Aperture Finance, and Gyro.finance. New DeFi protocols must prioritize auditing for this pattern before deployment.

6. **Source code transparency is a security baseline**: Contracts with unverified source code cannot be audited by the community, eliminating the opportunity for early vulnerability detection. Registering and verifying source code on block explorers such as Arbiscan is a fundamental obligation.

## 8. On-chain Verification

> Although the attack Tx (`0x51c22898a9b9f519a1...`) was provided, the full hash is unconfirmed, and since no Gyro.finance-specific public PoC or official post-mortem report exists, direct on-chain verification via `cast` could not be performed. The following is a summary of reference information.

### 8.1 Verification Methodology (cast-based)

```bash
# Perform on-chain verification with the commands below after confirming full Tx hash
ATTACK_TX="0x51c22898a9b9f519a1..."  # Full hash required
RPC_URL="https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."  # Arbitrum RPC

# Query basic transaction information
cast tx $ATTACK_TX --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Query event logs (confirm loss amount from Transfer events)
cast receipt --json $ATTACK_TX --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Execution trace (verify function call order)
cast run $ATTACK_TX --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### 8.2 Expected On-chain Event Sequence (based on Arbitrary Call pattern)

| Order | Event | Emitting Contract | Expected Content |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | External call | Attacker → Gyro router | `execute()` or similar function call |
| 2 | Transfer | ERC-20 token | `from=victim`, `to=attacker`, `amount=stolen amount` |
| 3 | (Repeat) | — | Same pattern may repeat for multiple victims |

### 8.4 Pattern DB Update Notice

The "Arbitrary Call" pattern confirmed in this incident is already covered in the existing `patterns/03_access_control.md` and `patterns/07_token_integration.md`. However, given the surge in Arbitrum-concentrated attacks in January 2026 — SwapNet ($13.4M), Aperture Finance ($3.67M), and Gyro.finance ($700K) — it is recommended to add the latest cases to `patterns/00_exploit_references.md`.
