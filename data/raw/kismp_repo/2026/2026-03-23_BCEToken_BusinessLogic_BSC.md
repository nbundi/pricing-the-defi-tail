## 1. Vulnerability Overview

BCE Token is a deflationary token traded on BSC through the PancakeSwap BCE/USDT pool. The token contains an internal mechanism that accumulates pending burn amounts in the `scheduledDestruction` state variable based on trade volume and pool reserves during sell transactions.

**Core Flaw**: The burn amount accumulated in `scheduledDestruction` is not deducted from the seller's balance; instead, it is **burned directly from the PancakeSwap pair contract's balance** via a separate code path, after which `sync()` is called. This allows an attacker to engineer a delayed burn that settles against LP reserves, manipulating pool depth and price with limited capital and extracting value from liquidity providers.

This vulnerability is a recurring pattern in BSC deflationary tokens — also seen in **LAXO Token (2026-02-22)** and **Movie Token MT (2026-03-10)** — and falls under the `burn mechanism abuse via AMM reserve manipulation` category.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

### 2.1 Delayed Burn Accumulation — Core Vulnerability

**Vulnerable Code (reconstructed)**:
```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable code — scheduledDestruction accumulation logic
uint256 public scheduledDestruction;  // ❌ Pending burn amount accumulated as a state variable

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    // Sell detection: from is a regular address, to is the PancakeSwap pair
    if (to == uniswapV2Pair && !_isExcludedFromFees[from]) {
        uint256 pairBalance = balanceOf(uniswapV2Pair);
        // ❌ Calculates and accumulates pending burn amount based on trade volume and pool reserves
        // This amount is NOT deducted from the seller!
        uint256 destructionAmount = (amount * pairBalance) / totalSupply();
        scheduledDestruction += destructionAmount;  // ❌ Only accumulates; no deduction from seller's balance
    }
    
    // ❌ Executes previously accumulated pending burn amount
    if (scheduledDestruction > 0) {
        _executeScheduledDestruction();  // ← Executed via a separate code path
    }
    
    super._transfer(from, to, amount);
}

function _executeScheduledDestruction() private {
    uint256 amount = scheduledDestruction;
    scheduledDestruction = 0;
    
    // ❌ Burns directly from the PancakeSwap pair, not the seller's balance!
    _burn(uniswapV2Pair, amount);
    
    // ❌ Calls sync() to reflect the manipulated reserves into the AMM
    IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).sync();
}
```

**Problem**: The pending burn amount (`scheduledDestruction`) is deducted from LP reserves rather than from the seller. An attacker can repeatedly buy and sell large amounts to intentionally inflate `scheduledDestruction`, drain the LP's BCE reserves to an extreme, cause a price spike, and realize the arbitrage profit.

**Fixed Code (✅)**:
```solidity
// ✅ Fix: Burns must be deducted from the seller's balance
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    if (to == uniswapV2Pair && !_isExcludedFromFees[from]) {
        // ✅ Deduct burn amount from the transfer amount first, charged to the seller
        uint256 burnAmount = (amount * BURN_RATE) / 10000;
        
        // ✅ Burn from the seller's amount first (no impact on LP reserves)
        _burn(from, burnAmount);
        amount -= burnAmount;
    }
    
    // ✅ Delayed burn state variable removed — handled immediately
    super._transfer(from, to, amount);
    // Note: sync() is not called. The AMM updates its own reserves.
}
```

### 2.2 Buy/Sell Limit Bypass

**Vulnerable Code (reconstructed)**:
```solidity
// ❌ Simple per-wallet transaction limit — bypassable with two malicious contracts
uint256 public maxTransactionAmount;
mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelisted;

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    if (!isWhitelisted[from] && !isWhitelisted[to]) {
        // ❌ Only checks individual wallet limits; assumes multi-contract attacks are impossible
        require(amount <= maxTransactionAmount, "Exceeds max transaction");
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Fixed Code (✅)**:
```solidity
// ✅ Fix: Per-block cumulative volume limit to prevent multi-contract bypass
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public blockVolume;  // ✅ Tracks volume on a per-block basis
uint256 public maxBlockVolume;

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    // ✅ Check cumulative per-block volume (prevents multi-contract bypass)
    blockVolume[block.number] += amount;
    require(blockVolume[block.number] <= maxBlockVolume, "Exceeds block volume limit");
    // ...
}
```

## 3. Attack Flow

### 3.1 Preparation Phase

- Attacker pre-deploys two malicious contracts (MC1, MC2)
- MC1: Receives flash loan and coordinates the entire attack
- MC2: Executes BCE/USDT swaps (purpose: bypass per-contract transaction limits)
- BCE token's `scheduledDestruction` mechanism analyzed and confirmed

### 3.2 Execution Phase

1. **Flash Loan Borrow**: MC1 borrows a 123.5M USDT flash loan from a lending protocol
2. **USDT→BCE Swap**: Buys 5.529M BCE with 2.222M USDT through MC2
3. **Reserve Pressure**: MC2 executes a series of USDT→BCE swaps totaling ~34.9M USDT → drives the pool's BCE reserves down to ~174K
4. **scheduledDestruction Accumulation**: Large-scale pending burn amount accumulates in `scheduledDestruction` during the bulk buy/transfer process
5. **LP Burn Execution**: Burn trigger fires — `scheduledDestruction` executes directly against the PancakeSwap pair → BCE reserves compressed to ~10,000
6. **Price Spike**: `sync()` call reflects the manipulated reserves into the AMM → BCE/USDT price surges
7. **BCE→USDT Arbitrage**: Swaps BCE for USDT at the manipulated price, securing massive arbitrage profit
8. **Flash Loan Repayment**: Repays flash loan principal + fee, retaining ~$679K net profit

## 5. Vulnerability Classification

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | CWE | Matching Pattern |
|----|--------|--------|-----|-----------|
| V-01 | Delayed burn mechanism that burns directly from LP reserves | CRITICAL | CWE-841 | 11_logic_error.md |
| V-02 | User-influenceable state variable manipulates third-party (LP) balance | CRITICAL | CWE-664 | 16_accounting_sync.md |
| V-03 | Buy/sell limit bypass (multi-contract) | HIGH | CWE-284 | 03_access_control.md |
| V-04 | Price manipulation combined with flash loan | HIGH | CWE-682 | 02_flash_loan.md |

### V-01: Delayed Burn Mechanism That Burns Directly from LP Reserves (CRITICAL)

- **Description**: The pending burn amount accumulated in the `scheduledDestruction` state variable is burned directly from the PancakeSwap pair contract's balance rather than from the seller's balance. `sync()` is then called to reflect the manipulated reserves into the AMM.
- **Impact**: The LP's BCE reserves are unintentionally burned, causing the USDT/BCE price ratio to skew sharply. The attacker realizes arbitrage profit by exploiting the distorted price.
- **Attack Condition**: Capital sufficient to intentionally inflate `scheduledDestruction` through large buy/sell operations (satisfiable via flash loan)

### V-02: User-Influenceable State Variable Manipulates Third-Party (LP) Balance (CRITICAL)

- **Description**: The `scheduledDestruction` variable can be indirectly manipulated by regular users' trading activity (selling). When this variable is executed, the LP contract's balance decreases rather than the user's own.
- **Impact**: The attacker gains a leverage effect — triggering large-scale LP reserve burns with a small amount of capital.
- **Attack Condition**: An entry point exists to manipulate the variable by repeatedly calling BCE token's `_transfer` function

### V-03: Buy/Sell Limit Bypass (HIGH)

- **Description**: BCE token's simple per-wallet/per-transaction trading limits can be bypassed using a distributed attack with two malicious contracts (MC1, MC2).
- **Impact**: Large-scale trades that would be impossible from a single contract are executed across multiple contracts, neutralizing the protection mechanism.
- **Attack Condition**: Pre-deployment of malicious contracts and analysis of the token's limit logic

### V-04: Price Manipulation Combined with Flash Loan (HIGH)

- **Description**: A flash loan temporarily provides large capital to accelerate `scheduledDestruction` accumulation and maximize LP reserve pressure.
- **Impact**: Attacks totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars become possible with only a small initial capital outlay.
- **Attack Condition**: Access to a flash loan provider protocol (universally available on BSC)

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Action — Fix the Burn Target

```solidity
// ✅ Critical fix: Burns must always be processed from the sender's or receiver's balance
// Never burn directly from the LP pair address's balance

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    uint256 transferAmount = amount;
    
    // ✅ On sell, deduct burn amount from the seller's balance first
    if (to == uniswapV2Pair && !_isExcludedFromFees[from]) {
        uint256 burnAmount = (amount * BURN_RATE_BPS) / 10000;
        
        // ✅ Burn from `from`'s balance (no impact on LP reserves)
        _burn(from, burnAmount);
        transferAmount = amount - burnAmount;
    }
    
    // ✅ scheduledDestruction state variable completely removed
    // ✅ sync() call removed (rely on AMM's own update mechanism)
    
    super._transfer(from, to, transferAmount);
}
```

### Structural Improvements

| Vulnerability | Recommended Action |
|--------|-----------|
| Direct LP burn | Prohibit the `_burn(pair, amount)` pattern entirely; detect with audit tooling |
| Delayed burn state variable | Process burns immediately (synchronously); prohibit deferred execution via state variable |
| Transaction limit bypass | Replace individual wallet limits with per-block cumulative volume limits |
| Flash loan mitigation | Enforce per-block maximum trade volume and prevent consecutive swaps within the same block |
| AMM sync() abuse | Validate that reserves have not changed before calling `sync()` |
| Code audit | Mandate professional audit before deploying deflationary tokens |

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Mechanisms that burn directly from the LP pair are extremely dangerous.** The `_burn(uniswapV2Pair, amount)` pattern directly manipulates AMM reserves and is a direct price manipulation vector. Burns must always be processed from the token holder's (`from`) balance.

2. **Deferred-execution state variables (scheduledDestruction) are exploitable vulnerabilities.** A design where user trading activity accumulates in a state variable that later impacts a third party (LP) allows attackers to intentionally build up state to maximize damage.

3. **The burn mechanism of deflationary tokens must be carefully examined for AMM interactions.** BSC reflection tokens and auto-burn tokens are vulnerable to AMM price manipulation when combined with flash loans. Simulating AMM reserve changes is essential during token design.

4. **Simple transaction limits are bypassed by multi-contract attacks.** Per-block cumulative volume limits are more effective than per-wallet/per-transaction limits. Separate limit logic for contract addresses should also be considered.

5. **This is a recurring pattern in BSC meme/deflationary tokens.** The same attack type has recurred across LAXO (2026-02), Movie Token MT (2026-03), and BCE (2026-03). On-chain monitoring tools that auto-detect this pattern are needed.

> Analysis based on attack Tx `0x85ac5d15f16d49ae08f90ab0e554ebfcb145712342c5b7704e305d602146d452` (cross-referenced with public reports)

### 8.1 PoC vs. On-Chain Amount Comparison

| Item | Public Analysis Value | Notes |
|------|------------|------|
| Flash loan borrowed | 123.5M USDT | Via lending protocol |
| USDT transferred to MC2 | 2.222M USDT | MC1 → MC2 |
| Initial USDT→BCE buy | 5.529M BCE | Using 2.222M USDT |
| Reserve pressure swaps | ~34.9M USDT volume | Sum of repeated swaps |
| BCE reserves after pressure | ~174K BCE | At swap completion |
| BCE reserves after LP burn | ~10,000 BCE | After scheduledDestruction execution |
| Net profit | ~$679,000 | On-chain verification not performed |

### 8.2 Key Attack Mechanism Steps

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | Large-scale USDT→BCE swaps | BCE reserves decrease, scheduledDestruction accumulates |
| 2 | Burn trigger | BCE burned directly from pair, reserves ~10K |
| 3 | sync() call | Manipulated reserves reflected into AMM, price spikes |
| 4 | BCE→USDT arbitrage | Receives large USDT amount at spiked price |
| 5 | Flash loan repayment | Returns principal + fee, net profit secured |

### 8.3 Precondition Verification

| Item | Status |
|------|------|
| BCE/USDT pool existence | Active (sufficient liquidity) |
| scheduledDestruction initial value | 0 (initialized state before attack) |
| Transaction limits | Bypassable via MC1/MC2 separation |
| Flash loan accessibility | BSC lending protocols available |

**On-chain direct verification not performed**: `cast` CLI or BSC node access required; document is based on public analysis reports. For precise verification, please check BscScan Tx [0x85ac5d15...](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x85ac5d15f16d49ae08f90ab0e554ebfcb145712342c5b7704e305d602146d452) directly.

## 9. Comparable Incident Comparison

| Incident | Date | Chain | Loss | Common Factor |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| LAXO Token | 2026-02-22 | BSC | ~263K USDT | Direct burn from LP + sync() |
| Movie Token (MT) | 2026-03-10 | BSC | Undisclosed | Pending burn LP pattern |
| **BCE Token** | **2026-03-23** | **BSC** | **~$679K** | **scheduledDestruction LP burn** |

All three incidents share **the same root cause** in BSC deflationary tokens: **burning directly from the LP pair balance and calling sync()**. It is recommended to add this pattern to the `16_accounting_sync.md` and `11_logic_error.md` pattern documents.
