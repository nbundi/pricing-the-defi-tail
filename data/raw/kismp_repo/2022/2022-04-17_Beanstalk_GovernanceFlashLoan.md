## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Beanstalk's governance uses the "Stalk" quantity of BEAN/LP tokens deposited in the Silo as voting power. The `emergencyCommit()` function was an emergency proposal execution path that bypassed the standard governance waiting period (7 days) and executed immediately when sufficient vote support was present.

The attacker pre-registered a malicious proposal (BIP-18) 24 hours in advance, then on the day of the attack borrowed $350 million worth of stablecoins via an Aave flash loan. They added liquidity to the Curve pool to obtain BEAN3CRV LP tokens, deposited these into SiloV2 to acquire a massive amount of Stalk (voting power), and used this voting power to immediately pass BIP-18 via `emergencyCommit()`, transferring all protocol assets to the attacker's address.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable Beanstalk governance (pseudocode)
contract BeanstalkGovernance {
    uint256 constant EMERGENCY_COMMIT_THRESHOLD = 2/3; // 2/3 of total Stalk

    function emergencyCommit(uint32 bip) external {
        // ❌ Calculates threshold using current block Stalk balance
        // Flash loan can acquire enough Stalk to meet the threshold
        uint256 userStalk = s.a[msg.sender].s.stalk;
        uint256 totalStalk = s.s.stalk;

        require(
            userStalk * 3 >= totalStalk * 2,  // holds 2/3 or more
            "insufficient stalk"
        );

        // ❌ Immediate execution — any proposal can be executed
        _execute(bip);
    }
}

// ✅ Correct pattern
contract BeanstalkGovernanceFixed {
    // ✅ Flash loan prevention: pin voting power snapshot block to proposal block
    function emergencyCommit(uint32 bip) external {
        BIP storage b = bips[bip];
        // ✅ Use Stalk snapshot at proposal time (not current value)
        uint256 userStalkAtProposal = b.userStalkSnapshot[msg.sender];
        uint256 totalStalkAtProposal = b.totalStalkSnapshot;

        require(
            userStalkAtProposal * 3 >= totalStalkAtProposal * 2,
            "insufficient stalk at proposal time"
        );
        _execute(bip);
    }
}

## 5. Vulnerability Classification (Table)

| Category | Details |
|------|-----------|
| **Vulnerability Type** | Governance voting power snapshot absence — `emergencyCommit()` calculates quorum using current block Stalk balance, allowing acquisition, exercise, and return of voting power within a single transaction |
| **CWE** | CWE-362: Race Condition due to Improper Synchronization |
| **OWASP DeFi** | Current-block balance-based governance (voting power without snapshot) |
| **Attack Vector** | Silo deposit → call `emergencyCommit()` (current block Stalk ≥ 2/3) → immediate execution |
| **Precondition** | `emergencyCommit()` uses current block `s.a[msg.sender].s.stalk` rather than a snapshot at proposal time |
| **Impact** | $182M in total protocol assets drained |

---
## 6. Remediation Recommendations

1. **Voting Power Snapshot**: Calculate voting power based on a snapshot taken at the proposal creation block.
2. **Flash Loan Blocking**: Prohibit deposit-vote-withdrawal within the same block.
3. **Remove or Restrict Emergency Execution Path**: Apply a minimum time delay (1–2 days) to emergencyCommit.
4. **Compound Governor Bravo Pattern**: Use a proven governance framework to implement snapshot-based voting.

---
## 7. Lessons Learned

- **Absent snapshot is the root cause**: Flash loans are merely a short-term capital acquisition tool. A whale with sufficient capital could execute the same attack via deposit→vote→withdraw within the same block. The root cause is a design flaw in which `emergencyCommit()` uses the current block balance rather than a snapshot at proposal time as voting power.
- **The paradox of emergencyCommit**: An emergency execution path designed for rapid response becomes a vector for single-transaction takeover when it uses current-balance-based quorum without a timelock.
- **$182M loss**: The Beanstalk attack is a canonical example of the governance snapshot absence vulnerability and had a significant influence on DeFi governance design thereafter.
- **Tornado Cash donation**: The attacker processed a portion of the proceeds through a donation to Ukraine and via Tornado Cash.
