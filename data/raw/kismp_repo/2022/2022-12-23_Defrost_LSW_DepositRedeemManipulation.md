# Defrost (LSW) — deposit()/redeem() Price Mismatch Attack Analysis

| Field | Details |
|------|------|
| **Date** | 2022-12-23 |
| **Protocol** | Defrost Finance (LSW) |
| **Chain** | Avalanche |
| **Loss** | ~$173,000 (v2/LSW contract only; confirmed by PeckShield post-mortem — separate from the larger Dec 24-25 Defrost v1 fake-collateral attack which is undocumented here) |
| **LSW (Vulnerable Contract)** | [0xfF152e21C5A511c478ED23D1b89Bb9391bE6de96](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xfF152e21C5A511c478ED23D1b89Bb9391bE6de96) |

| **Root Cause** | LSW's `flashLoan()` lacked a reentrancy guard; the attacker's `onFlashLoan()` callback called `deposit()` while the flash loan was still in-flight, minting shares against the pre-repayment USDC balance and then redeeming them for more USDC than deposited (reentrancy via flash loan callback enabling double-counting of vault assets) |

## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Defrost Finance's LSW (Lending Share Wrapper) contract accepted USDC deposits and issued shares via an ERC4626-like design that also exposed a `flashLoan()` function. The critical flaw was that `flashLoan()` lacked a reentrancy guard: after transferring USDC to the borrower and invoking `onFlashLoan()`, the LSW vault's USDC balance was temporarily inflated (the flash-loaned amount was still counted before repayment). The attacker exploited this by calling `deposit()` from inside `onFlashLoan()` — minting shares against the pre-repayment (artificially high) vault balance and then immediately redeeming them, receiving more USDC than deposited because the share-to-asset ratio was computed against a double-counted balance. Sources: Halborn, MetaTrust, CoinCodeCap post-mortems all identify the missing reentrancy lock (not rounding mismatch) as the root cause.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

```solidity
// ❌ Vulnerable LSW - deposit/redeem price mismatch
contract LSW is ERC4626 {
    // ❌ On deposit: shares over-issued due to floor rounding
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
        public override returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        // ❌ convertToShares uses floor (round-down) calculation
        shares = _convertToSharesFloor(assets);
        _mint(receiver, shares);
        USDC.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    }

    // ❌ On redeem: assets over-returned due to ceil rounding
    function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)
        public override returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        // ❌ convertToAssets uses ceil (round-up) calculation
        assets = _convertToAssetsCeil(shares);
        _burn(owner, shares);
        USDC.transfer(receiver, assets);  // ❌ Can return more than deposited
    }

    // ❌ Price calculation mismatch: deposit(floor) vs redeem(ceil)
    // When 1 share = 1.0001 USDC:
    // deposit(1000 USDC) → 999 shares (floor)
    // redeem(999 shares) → 1000.999 USDC (ceil) → +0.999 USDC profit
}

// ✅ Correct pattern - consistent rounding direction (ERC4626 standard compliant)
contract SafeLSW is ERC4626 {
    // ✅ ERC4626: deposit uses floor, redeem uses floor (unfavorable to depositor)
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
        public override returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        shares = _convertToSharesFloor(assets);  // round down
        _mint(receiver, shares);
        asset.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    }

    function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)
        public override returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = _convertToAssetsFloor(shares);  // ✅ round down (standard compliant)
        _burn(owner, shares);
        asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
    }
}
```


### On-Chain Source Code

Source: Unverified

> ⚠️ No on-chain source code — bytecode only or source not verified

**Vulnerable Function** — `deposit()`:
```solidity
// ❌ Root cause: LSW's `deposit()` calculates shares using floor rounding and `redeem()` returns assets using ceil rounding, allowing an attacker to always receive more USDC than deposited in a deposit→redeem cycle with the same amount (ERC4626 rounding direction mismatch)
// Source code unverified — bytecode analysis required
// Vulnerability: LSW's `deposit()` calculates shares using floor rounding and `redeem()` returns assets using ceil rounding, allowing an attacker to always receive more USDC than deposited in a deposit→redeem cycle with the same amount (ERC4626 rounding direction mismatch)
```

    │               ❌ Returns more USDC than deposited due to ceil calculation

## 5. Vulnerability Classification (Table)

| Category | Details |
|------|-----------|
| **Vulnerability Type** | Reentrancy via flash loan callback (missing nonReentrant on flashLoan/deposit) |
| **CWE** | CWE-841: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow (Reentrancy) |
| **OWASP DeFi** | Flash loan reentrancy enabling double-counting of vault assets |
| **Attack Vector** | Uniswap V2 flash swap → LSW `flashLoan()` → `deposit()` inside `onFlashLoan()` (vault balance double-counted) → `redeem()` for excess USDC |
| **Preconditions** | `flashLoan()` lacks reentrancy guard; `deposit()` callable during active flash loan, double-counting the not-yet-repaid USDC |
| **Impact** | USDC arbitrage profit (scale unconfirmed) |

## 6. Remediation Recommendations

1. **Apply `nonReentrant` to `flashLoan()`**: The flash loan function must prevent reentrant calls to `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()` during its execution. OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` covers this.
2. **Apply `nonReentrant` to all state-mutating vault functions**: `deposit()`, `mint()`, `redeem()`, and `withdraw()` must all carry the reentrancy guard so no combination of callbacks can double-count vault balances.
3. **Snapshot balance before external callback**: Record the vault balance before issuing the flash loan; use the snapshot (not live balance) for any share calculations that occur during the callback period.
4. **Validate repayment before re-enabling deposits**: The vault should confirm the flash loan is fully repaid before allowing further deposits in the same transaction.

## 7. Lessons Learned

- **Flash loan + vault reentrancy is a distinct class from ERC4626 rounding attacks**: The root cause here was a missing reentrancy guard, not rounding direction. Confusing the two leads to incomplete fixes — adding correct rounding would not have prevented this attack.
- **Vault balance double-counting**: When a vault lends its own assets via `flashLoan()` and the callback is allowed to call `deposit()`, the loaned funds are counted twice in the share calculation. This is logically equivalent to a reentrancy exploit even if the callback does not reenter the same function.
- **Combined flash loan + ERC4626 interfaces require extra care**: Any contract that exposes both lending (flashLoan) and savings (deposit/redeem) on the same asset pool must treat the lending callback as an untrusted external call and lock all vault state functions for its duration.
- **Separate from the larger Defrost Finance attack**: The Dec 24–25 Defrost v1 fake-collateral attack (~$12M) is a different vulnerability on a different contract. This LSW reentrancy incident ($173K) targeted the v2 LSW wrapper.
