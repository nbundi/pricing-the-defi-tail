# Optimism — Wintermute Vanity Address Proxy Deployment Failure Analysis

| Item | Details |
|------|------|
| **Date** | 2022-06-09 |
| **Protocol** | Optimism (OP Token) / Wintermute |
| **Chain** | Optimism |
| **Loss** | 20,000,000 OP tokens temporarily taken — an unknown actor deployed to the vanity address and claimed the tokens, but returned all 20M OP to Wintermute after negotiations (~1 week). Net permanent loss: $0. |
| **Related Address** | [0x4f3a120E72C76c22ae802D129F599BFDbc31cb81](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4f3a120E72C76c22ae802D129F599BFDbc31cb81) (non-existent vanity address) |
| **Vulnerable Contract** | ProxyFactory [0x76E2cFc1F5Fa8F6a5b3fC4c8F4788F0116861F9B](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x76E2cFc1F5Fa8F6a5b3fC4c8F4788F0116861F9B) |
| **Root Cause** | Wintermute sent OP tokens to a vanity address (CREATE opcode-based) that was deployed on Ethereum but had never been deployed on Optimism. The PoC demonstrates that the address can be generated on Optimism by looping through ProxyFactory `createProxy()` calls |

## 1. Vulnerability Overview

This incident was not a traditional smart contract vulnerability, but rather an accident caused by a misunderstanding of cross-chain address consistency.

Wintermute assumed that the vanity address (`0x4f3a120E72C76c22ae802D129F599BFDbc31cb81`) used on Ethereum also existed identically on Optimism, and sent 20,000,000 OP tokens to that address. However, contract addresses generated using the CREATE opcode can differ per chain because the deploying transaction nonce may vary — meaning Ethereum's vanity address did not automatically exist on Optimism.

The DeFiHackLabs PoC demonstrates that by repeatedly calling the `createProxy()` function on Optimism's ProxyFactory, the vanity address can be reproduced on Optimism. This shows that an attacker who gains control of the contract at that address could withdraw the OP tokens.

## 2. Vulnerable Code Analysis

```solidity
// ProxyFactory: a specific address can be generated via createProxy
contract ProxyFactory {
    // CREATE opcode: address = keccak256(rlp([factory, nonce]))[12:]
    // By deploying enough proxies, the target address can be reached
    function createProxy(
        address masterCopy,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (address payable proxy) {
        // ❌ Callable by anyone — target address reachable by consuming nonces
        proxy = new GnosisSafeProxy(masterCopy);
        if (data.length > 0) {
            // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
            assembly {
                if eq(call(gas(), proxy, 0, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0), 0) {
                    revert(0, 0)
                }
            }
        }
        emit ProxyCreation(proxy, masterCopy);
    }
}

// ❌ Vulnerable cross-chain assumption (conceptual error)
// On Ethereum: factory.nonce = 5 → proxy address = 0x4f3a...
// On Optimism: factory.nonce = 0 → proxy address ≠ 0x4f3a...
//              factory.nonce = N(?) → proxy address = 0x4f3a...
//              → reachable by calling createProxy() N times

// ✅ Correct cross-chain address management
// Use CREATE2: keccak256(0xff, factory, salt, bytecodeHash)
// → Setting the same salt guarantees the same address on every chain
contract SafeProxyFactoryFixed {
    function createProxyWithNonce(
        address masterCopy,
        bytes calldata initializer,
        uint256 saltNonce  // ✅ Deterministic salt
    ) external returns (address payable proxy) {
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(keccak256(initializer), saltNonce));
        // ✅ CREATE2: generates the same address regardless of chain
        proxy = deployProxyWithNonce(masterCopy, initializer, salt);
    }
}
```

## 5. Vulnerability Classification (Table)

| Category | Details |
|------|-----------|
| **Vulnerability Type** | Cross-chain address mismatch (incorrect vanity address assumption) |
| **CWE** | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (recipient address not verified) |
| **OWASP DeFi** | Misunderstanding of CREATE opcode address non-determinism across chains |
| **Attack Vector** | Squatting the target vanity address by looping ProxyFactory `createProxy()` |
| **Precondition** | Wintermute sent OP tokens before deploying the vanity address on Optimism |
| **Impact** | Potential theft of 20,000,000 OP (~$20M at time) |

---
## 6. Remediation Recommendations

1. **Use CREATE2**: When cross-chain address consistency is required, use CREATE2 with a deterministic salt instead of CREATE. Given the same salt and bytecode, the same address is generated on every EVM chain.
2. **Verify address before token transfer**: Before sending large amounts of tokens, always confirm that the destination address has deployed code (`extcodesize`).
3. **Verify addresses when deploying to new chains**: Before reusing an existing Ethereum address on a new chain, confirm that the contract has been identically deployed at that address.
4. **Understand vanity address risk**: Vanity addresses created via the CREATE opcode depend on the factory nonce, so the same address is not guaranteed across chains.

---
## 7. Lessons Learned

- **CREATE vs CREATE2**: Contract addresses generated by CREATE are a function of the deployer address and nonce, so they are not guaranteed to be identical across chains. CREATE2 generates addresses deterministically by incorporating a salt.
- **The pitfall of multi-chain expansion**: To reuse an address from Ethereum on a new L2/sidechain, the same deployment process must be executed there first.
- **20M OP**: While no actual attack occurred (Wintermute pre-empted and reclaimed the address themselves), the exploitability was real, making this an important case study.
- **The role of public PoCs**: The DeFiHackLabs PoC proved exploitability and raised awareness about similar cross-chain pitfalls.
